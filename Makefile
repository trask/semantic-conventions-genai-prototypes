# Rewrite absolute /docs/... links in generated docs so they resolve on GitHub.
#
# The upstream markdown templates were designed for the monorepo case where
# every linked page lives under the same repo. Downstream registries like this
# one import attributes from open-telemetry/semantic-conventions but host local
# pages only for the namespaces they own (gen-ai, mcp, openai), so links to
# shared namespaces (server, error, network, ...) and to upstream-only prose
# pages (/docs/general/recording-errors.md, /docs/general/metric-requirement-level.md)
# 404 on GitHub as generated. Hugo-side rendering is unaffected.
#
# This is a short-lived bridge. The real fix lives in the new shared markdown
# template package being designed in open-telemetry/opentelemetry-weaver-packages
# (see PR #29 and successors), which will expose parameters for cross-registry
# link bases and handle empty registries (no entities, no metrics, etc.) by
# construction. Remove this target, its callers, UPSTREAM_ATTR_NAMESPACES, and
# UPSTREAM_DOCS_BASE once TEMPLATE_REPO is migrated to the packages repo and
# exposes the new params.
