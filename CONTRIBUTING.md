# Contributing

Welcome to the OpenTelemetry GenAI Semantic Conventions repository!

New to OpenTelemetry? Read the
[New Contributor Guide](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/guides/contributor/README.md)
first — it covers the CLA, Code of Conduct, and other prerequisites.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (or a compatible runtime
  such as Podman aliased as `docker`) — `make` runs Weaver via the
  `otel/weaver` container image.
- [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) — pre-installed on macOS
  and Linux. On Windows, use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install)
  or install via [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) (`choco install make`)
  or [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) (`scoop install make`).

## Code structure

```
├── docs
│   ├── gen-ai/            # hand-written docs with embedded generated tables
│   └── registry/          # auto-generated attribute registry pages
├── model
│   └── <namespace>/       # e.g. gen-ai, mcp, openai
│       ├── registry.yaml  # attribute definitions
│       ├── spans.yaml     # span conventions
│       ├── metrics.yaml   # metric conventions
│       ├── events.yaml    # event conventions
│       └── deprecated/    # deprecated conventions
```

All attributes must be defined in `registry.yaml` files under the matching
namespace folder in `model/`.

## Making a change

### 1. Modify the YAML model

Refer to the
[Semantic Convention YAML Language](https://github.com/open-telemetry/weaver/blob/main/schemas/semconv-syntax.md)
to learn about the YAML file syntax.

### 2. Regenerate the docs

After updating the YAML, run:

```bash
make generate-docs
```

This regenerates the attribute registry pages under `docs/registry/` and
refreshes the generated tables embedded in the hand-written docs under
`docs/gen-ai/`.

### 3. Validate

Run the shared policy checks:

```bash
make check-policies
```

This validates the model against shared OpenTelemetry policies covering
naming conventions, attribute type rules, stability requirements, and
backwards compatibility.

### 4. Update reference scenarios

Changes under `model/` or `docs/` typically require updating the
reference scenarios under `reference/` to demonstrate that the proposed
updates are capturable. See
[reference/CONTRIBUTING.md](reference/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### 5. Update the changelog

Add an entry under `Unreleased` in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for any
change a consumer of these conventions would need to notice. Editorial
changes (typos, rewording, non-normative clarifications) don't need an
entry.

## Keep PRs small

Small, focused PRs are much easier to review, and therefore much more
likely to land quickly. Consider phasing larger changes across multiple PRs
where possible.

## Driving a PR forward

Design questions and proposals are best discussed with the
[GenAI SIG](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community#sig-genai-instrumentation).
When a PR needs more eyes, post in
[#otel-genai-instrumentation](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C06KR7ARS3X)
on [CNCF Slack](https://slack.cncf.io/) or raise it at the next SIG meeting.

If the review surfaces contentious or difficult points, consider splitting
them into follow-up PRs so the uncontroversial parts can land and each
harder point gets its own focused discussion and review.
